# Notes

- set up rclone to grab gdrive/computer project files, stuff into btrfs subvol for syncing
- copy stuff from vmware readonly share folders (so they get grandfathered-in with subvol backups)

- make github credentials PERSISTENT, re-run reverse-flash
- re-work @cache layout as per @cache readme
- emudeck + n64 + ...?
