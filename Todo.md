# Notes

- have kde autostart login script automatically run reverse-flash so you get todo.md backed up?
- re-tool vmware new shares for 'To Linux', 'To Windows', etc
- re-work @cache layout as per @cache readme
- copy stuff from vmware readonly share folders (so they get grandfathered-in with subvol backups)
- set up rclone to grab gdrive/computer project files, stuff into btrfs subvol for syncing
- emudeck + n64 + ...?
