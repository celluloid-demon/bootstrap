# Notes

- re-seed backup over WIRED CONNECTION (then don't forget to re-enable for autostart)
    - note: you'll need to finish seeding the FULL snapshot list, THEN attempt to sync using btrfs-sync tool
- re-work @cache layout as per @cache readme
- copy stuff from vmware readonly share folders (so they get grandfathered-in with subvol backups)
- set up rclone to grab gdrive/computer project files, stuff into btrfs subvol for syncing
- emudeck + n64 + ...?
